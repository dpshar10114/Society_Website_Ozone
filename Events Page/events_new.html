						<b>Dart HTC(Techno-Social Quiz)</b>
					</summary>
					<p> 
						The annual event of the society, DART-HTC is a quiz organized by the society in order to test the IQ level of the new students at the institute. Targeting the freshers, the quiz level is kept moderate covering topics from day to day life so that the students doesnâ€™t face a lot of trouble while participating.
					</p>
					<p>
						The major attraction of the quiz is the Graphics Round in which different type of sub-round takes pace. The quiz does consist of a jackpot round in which any team can make a phase of change and win the event.
					</p>
					<p>
						The event is fascinating enough to attract a crowd of 70-80 students in a team of 4 students every year. The winning team is awarded and if is organised as an introductory event then the reward is the advantage of skipping the first round of the Annual Recruitment of the society.

						<b>Excursion to Mussoorie</b>

					<p> 
						The OZONE Society believes that some relaxation is necessary for every individual in order to maintain balance between the academics and this competitive world. Therefore, we organised an Excursion to the Queen of Hills, Mussoorie
					</p>
					<p>
						The tour was open to every individual of the institute, and we successfully managed in enjoying the three-day excursion along-with a group of 30 students accompanied by two of faculty members, Dr. Nidhi Sharma (Mentor of Society) & Mr. Hardik Chaudhary (Administration Dept.). The excursion would not have been possible without the support of Dr. Mukesh Kumar (Head of Dept., Computer Engineering).
					</p>
					<p>
						The excursion was a great success, and the students made a lot of beautiful memories during the excursion. All the arrangements were made prior in hand and the society looks forward to plan many such excursions in the future.

						Under this, all the participants have to scan a QR code, in order to find the clue, to the next destination. At every destination, they find a part of the complete mystery, which they are supposed to solve.

						The mystery changes every year but the principles remains the same. This makes this event, a complete fun, with healthy competition between different groups.
