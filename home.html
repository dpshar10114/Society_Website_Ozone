		<h3>#Being_Technical</h3>
		<p>
			THE OZONE (Open source ZONE) SOCIETY, &nbsp; is one of the fastest developing societies at TIT&S Bhiwani. We at OZONE focus on the all-round development of our members. Originally started as the “Technical Society” of our institute, OZONE is now also excelling in all internal and external affairs of the institute. We have successfully managed to work as an organisation consisting of the most efficient work personals, with the auspicious guidance of our Hon. Mentors Dr. Nidhi Sharma & Dr. Monika Sharma.
		</p>
		<p>
			We believe that the intra-society relationship between the members do play a vital role in the overall development of the members and the society, so we do organise different excursion programs and get togethers for building up the peer-to-peer relationship among the society members.
